# Background
- Your team project is to make a web replica of the original game Oregon Trail. (found [here](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990))
# Assignment
- The project is to make this game web-based using JavaScript, PHP, AJAX, and MySQL. How you use each will be up to the team design, but at the very least, to keep the high score should be using MySQL. There will be a ton of programming just the overall game logic. This should be taken care of by JavaScript, PHP, etc…
- In one departure from the original, there is an option in the game to hunt for food. This would be difficult to render in JavaScript, so to simplify have the leader of the group go fishing and give random chances on if a fish is caught, and how heavy it is.
- Second departure “can” be the graphics. They do not have to be the same hideous graphics of the DOS game. You can update, but should be in the same theme.
- Third, for those that were brand new to the game, some helpful hint (especially when buying or just starting to travel) would be suggested.
